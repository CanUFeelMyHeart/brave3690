how it's made by me
## 1. Fork repository:
    - On Github native to the https://github.com/CanUFeelMyHeart/brave3690.git repository.
    - In top-right corner of the page ,click *Fork*
    - Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.(and its i am).
    - By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
    - Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
    - Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. If you do not select this option, all branches will be copied into the new fork.
